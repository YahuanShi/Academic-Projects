    "# Programming Hidden Markov Models (60 P)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will experiment with hidden Markov models, in particular, applying them to modeling character sequences, and analyzing the learned solution. As a starting point, you are provided in the file `hmm.py` with a basic implementation of an HMM and of the Baum-Welch training algorithm. The names of variables used in the code and the references to equations are taken from the HMM paper by Rabiner et al. downloable from ISIS. In addition to the variables described in this paper, we use two additional variables: $Z$ for the emission probabilities of observations $O$, and $\\psi$ (i.e. psi) for collecting the statistics of Equation (40c).\n"
