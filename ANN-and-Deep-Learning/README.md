# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## 🎯 Course Description

This course provides a broad and rigorous introduction to neural networks and modern deep learning techniques. It covers theoretical foundations, training algorithms, and hands-on implementation of deep architectures. The focus is both on understanding core principles and applying deep learning models to solve complex engineering problems.

Topics include:
- Feedforward neural networks and backpropagation
- Regularization techniques: weight decay, dropout, early stopping
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their variants
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and sequence modeling
- Attention mechanisms, Transformers, and sequence-to-sequence learning
- Autoencoders, GANs, and representation learning
- Application of deep learning to computer vision tasks

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, I was able to:

- Understand theoretical results underpinning neural networks (universal approximation, vanishing/exploding gradients)
- Train and evaluate deep models using optimization techniques (SGD, Adam, etc.)
- Implement and fine-tune CNN, RNN, and Transformer-based architectures
- Apply deep learning models to real-world tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection
- Use PyTorch to develop, train, and visualize deep models

| Assignment | Folder | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| Assignment 1 | [`assignment-01`](./assignment-01) | **Image Classification** task using CNNs. Built, trained, and optimized convolutional models to classify images into predefined categories (e.g., CIFAR, MNIST or similar datasets). Focus on architectural design, training performance, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.). |
| Assignment 2 | [`assignment-02`](./assignment-02) | **Semantic Segmentation** task. Implemented a pixel-wise classification model (e.g., using FCN or U-Net) for identifying and segmenting image regions. Focus on spatial accuracy, loss balancing, and IoU score evaluation. |

## 📝 Notes

The course combined both theoretical depth and practical coding exercises. Assignments were modeled as Kaggle challenges, testing both my modeling and problem-solving skills. The final projects demonstrate a complete pipeline: data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.
