# Automatic Image Analysis

## Course Description

This course covers both classical and modern methods for automatic image analysis, combining techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.

Topics range from visual cognition and shape descriptors to deep neural networks and advanced techniques such as self-supervised learning and transformers. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using deep learning frameworks.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply models of visual cognition and shape representation.
- Implement classic computer vision algorithms such as Hough Transform and shape models.
- Apply Bayesian decision theory and probability estimation to image analysis tasks.
- Design and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image understanding.
- Analyze temporal visual data using deep learning approaches.
- Implement modern architectures such as transformers and self-supervised learning models.
- Explore advanced topics including scene graphs and the integration of large language models (LLMs) with image analysis.
