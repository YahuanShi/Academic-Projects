## 📂 General Task Overview

The general task includes six sub-problems that simulate realistic data analysis challenges faced in engineering settings:

1. **Logistics Delay Analysis** (K7 component):  
   - Merge datasets and analyze delay distributions using statistical tests and visualizations  
   - Train a decision tree to predict part defectiveness

2. **Data Storage Concepts**:  
   - Benefits of relational structure, normalization principles

3. **Vehicle Part Tracing (T16)**:  
   - Query dataset to find T16 parts installed in vehicles registered in Adelshofen

4. **Schema Analysis**:  
   - Analyze the data types of the vehicle registration table

5. **Linear Model for Mileage**:  
   - Fit regression model and derive actionable OEM insights

6. **Hit and Run Investigation**:  
   - Trace vehicle body part to registered location using structured queries

## 🧪 Case Study Overview

In this task, I worked as a data analyst for a fictitious automotive company “217” to investigate a **systemic quality failure** caused by faulty steel used between **June 2012 and July 2014**. The task involved:

- Tracing components processed during the affected time window
- Matching them with production batches, customers, and vehicle types
- Identifying affected OEMs (OEM1, OEM2) and car types (Type11, Type12, Type21, Type22)
- Producing a report that informs which customers need to be contacted

💡 This project demonstrated my ability to:
- Work with multiple relational datasets
- Derive insights from temporal and relational data
- Deliver a comprehensive and data-driven business decision pipeline

📂 See [`case-study`](./case-study) folder for data processing, decision logic, and report outputs.
