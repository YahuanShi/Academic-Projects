# Motion Planning

## 🎯 Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive and unified introduction to motion planning, covering geometric, kinodynamic, and optimal planning methods. Topics span multiple algorithmic families (search-, sampling-, and optimization-based), with a strong emphasis on both theory and practical tools used in robotics, autonomous systems, and industrial automation.

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, I was able to:

- Formalize geometric, kinodynamic, and optimal motion planning problems
- Analyze and compare the theoretical properties of planners (completeness, optimality, complexity)
- Implement basic versions of:
  - Sampling-based planners (RRT, PRM, RRT*)
  - Search-based planners (A*, SBPL)
  - Optimization-based planners (SCP, KOMO)
- Use standard libraries such as **OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library)**
